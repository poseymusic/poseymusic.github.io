Unit 5 Project Sample: 
Nematocyst Design

Step 1: Define Audience / Tone

Who will visit your site? Potential employers? New clients or customers?
Employers and clients seeking a UI designer/developer

What can make you and/or your product stand out against your competitors?
Showing my design and development process from a to z in a linear format

How would you speak to your clientele if you were communicating in person? How could you translate that style and tone digitally?
In an unconventional, unique way… expressive design… something outside the bounds of a simple static site

What colors represent you or your product?
Blue for the sea, green for the forest, grey for the sky (this is more branding than anything)

What images illustrate your message?
Diffuse images to display tone… images of sea life to carry a message… i.e. dolphins or whales for communication, tentacled creatures for capturing attention, etc.



Step 2: Define Site Structure

What are the three-to-five pages titled?

Work, About, and Contact

What will be the purpose for each?
Work will display individual projects in an image based format from inception to final build.

Contact is obvious

About will display text about me, what I do, possibly my resume




What should each page contain? Will there be textual content? Or just images?
