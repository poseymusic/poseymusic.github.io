Step 3: Create Wireframes

Okay. Time to remove your client hat and put on your designer hat. Ready?

Review the document your partner has emailed you. Using lines and basic shapes, create wireframes for their website. Remember to incorporate boxes for the nav, header, footer, and body.

Think about the meaning and utility of each page, and decide which design patterns will remain consistent across the site and which design patterns will change depending on page-specific content.

As you're creating wireframes, make sure to keep the design principles we've learned in mind, such as focal point, hierarchy, balance, and grid-based layouts.
Step 4: Submission and Feedback

Email your partner the wireframes you created for them. In the email, make sure to ask what they would like changed as well as the following questions:

    Will the wireframe appeal to the site's visitors?
    Are your products or services elevated in you website's hierarchy?
    Would the page stand out against your competitor's pages?
    Does the style represent your restaurant's / business's brand?

Step 5: Update Wireframes

Once you've received your partner's general feedback and the answers to the questions listed above, make revisions to your original design of the wireframes.
