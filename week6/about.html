	<h2>What do I do?</h2>
	<p>I make Websites and Webapps. I design them and develop the frontend. After working a couple of years in various web design agencies in Switzerland, I decided to go freelance in October 2012. I am specialized in responsive design. Check out my latest work in my portfolio.
	</p>
	<p>I'm web designer & front-end developer with 7 years of professional experience. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web, mobile & tablet interfaces. I also have skills in other fields like branding, icon design or web development.

	Earlier I was full-time freelancer for 6 years behind my studio Precise Design. Currently I'm working for little overgrown czech “start-up” called Heureka.cz Restu.cz as a Senior UI/UX designer Product designer.</p>
