Design Critique Guidelines: Presenting Your Work

* The critique is built upon a community of trust. The discussion is about your work—not about you as an individual.
* Set the context at the outset. Help your audience understand the problem you were trying to solve.
* Invite specific feedback. Ask questions that elicit focused guidance, rather than generalized feedback.
* Listen openly. Not every piece of feedback requires a response.
* Take notes and respond strategically. During a critique, consider new ideas, admit when you’re wrong, and "kill your darlings" —ideas for which you're sentimental, but which no longer help your design—when needed.

Help your audience understand the problem you were trying to solve.

Step 1: Reflection

Create a document answering the following:

    Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?
    Which parts of the design are you most proud of?
    What struggles did you encounter in your design process?
    Which struggles did you encounter during page development?
    What did you learn from making your project responsive?     

Step 2: Reviews

Review a website from group 1 and a website from group 2 of the following list, commenting on each website's layout, typography, navigation, and overall flow.
